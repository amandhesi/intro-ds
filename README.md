# Intro to Data Analysis with Jupyter
-------

First, clone this repository locally. We will be running Jupyter locally and using it to work on the notebook in this repository.

## Setup

We need to make sure you have Python installed, and then we need to install Jupyter. I recommend doing this inside a virtual environment to make your life simpler.

- Download and install Python 3 here: https://www.python.org/downloads/
- Open up a Terminal window and run `python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv` to install virtualenv
- Run `python3 -m virtualenv venv` inside the root folder of the repository to create a virtualenv
- Run `source venv/bin/activate` in the root folder of the repository to activate the virtualenv
- Run `python3 -m pip install jupyter pandas matplotlib` to install Jupyter and pandas

Congratulations, you now have Jupyter set up and can run the `intro.ipynb` notebook. 

Run `jupyter notebook` in a terminal window. Once the browser window opens with the Jupyter UI, navigate to the repository folder and click on `intro.ipynb`
